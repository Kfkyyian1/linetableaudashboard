### 2. Friends Dataset:
- Total Friends: Total followers

# Data Insights:
1. Yearly Trends: The average total friends show a consistent increase year on year. However, blocked accounts increased from 2020 to 2021, with a slight decrease in 2022. Simultaneously, the average number of target reach friends is decreasing, indicating potential user disengagement. They might be phasing out of LINE and prefer to use other social messaging platforms instead.
2. Category Analysis: Product and campaign categories exhibit higher average open counts, while product and promo categories have the highest average clickthrough. Users are more engaged with product-related messaging, indicating a desire to explore new product launches and make purchases.
3. Content Format Effectiveness: Plain vanilla static content format demonstrates the highest average clickthrough, suggesting that this format requires minimal user interaction and encourages direct engagement with the call-to-action.
